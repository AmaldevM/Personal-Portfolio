I’m Amaldev M, a BCA graduate and Junior Full Stack Developer with hands-on experience building responsive, user-focused web applications. I’ve worked on real-world projects and internships, and I recently built my own portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and experience. I’m eager to contribute, learn, and grow in a professional development environment.
